# game-solvers
Random game solver programs
Many interesting problems can be solved easily with the resursive algorithms.
This repo contains all the game related problems solved with recurions.

Key points to note here:
* A small piece of code doing a lot of the computing
* Use stack memory instead of allocating incrementally
* Trial and rollback with stack increasing or decreasing
